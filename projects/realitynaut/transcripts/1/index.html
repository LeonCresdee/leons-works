	and I’m applying to be a part of this years Make Shift camp.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-p0vhvb">My main motivation for wanting to be a part of this years camp is to meet people who also get
	excited about making and doing creative things with technology. I’m always in search of those
	incredible people who garner both the bubbling creativity to think of new ideas and the technical
	prowess to bring them to life. With both the other attendees and members from Pervasive Media
	Studio this camp seems like it’ll be bringing together an incredible group of people for the cause
	of innovation and play and I’d love to be a part of it.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1gbkgfa">Along with those people I’m sure comes a wealth of skills and talent I’d hope to learn from,
	whether it be technical abilities or new approaches to creativity. But I’d also hope to think I
	can assist others and share some of my own knowledge and skills.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-12y3xkc">Lastly I’m excited about the opportunity to put aside time and given support to work on a creative
	project. As someone who works fulltime in a technical roll, and tries to maintain some form of
	social life. Often I struggle to find the time or focus to work on something personal with a
	creative endeavour. So it’d be nice to spend a week in a supportive space and accomplish something
	motivated entirely by creativity.</p>
